# LagrangesFourSquares
( for background, see the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_four-square_theorem'>wikipedia page</a> )     
Just some programming practice to find the 4 squares that sum to a given number

This is the first working version, but it is really really really inefficient. Starts becoming unbearably slow after input is larger than ~150 and has serious trouble with any <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_four-square_theorem#Uniqueness'>unique numbers</a>

Will eventually post a faster version, but I was just proud to have found any solution at all   ~
